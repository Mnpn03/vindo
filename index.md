Vindo is a Mac program that runs Windows programs. It takes a unique approach to doing this that avoids the performance penalty of a VM, while allowing you to run Windows programs without restarting your computer.

Vindo is also completely free and open source. Compare this to VMWare, which cost $89.99 for VMWare, plus $119 for a copy of Windows 10, plus $1299 for a computer fast enough to virtualize Windows.
