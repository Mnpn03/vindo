Q: How does it work?  
A: Programs like VMWare work by creating a complete virtual computer, running inside your existing computer, and then running Windows and Windows programs in that.
Vindo works in a similar way, but it takes advantage of the fact that since you are already using a computer, you don't need virtual memory, or a virtual hard disk,
or a virtual CPU. It just uses your real memory, hard disk, and CPU.
