Tech Support:

You can email us with any questions or concerns. If you're in the heat of the moment and can't figure out why something won't work,
there's a chat feature built into Vindo where you can message us and we'll get back to you either instantly or as soon as we can 
(probably same-day, if not within an hour or two.) It's interfaced directly into our private Slack chat that we use to communicate with
each other, and we monitor it on both our phones when we're in class and our computers when we're working. Tired of not getting
support for the programs you love? Welcome to a new age.
