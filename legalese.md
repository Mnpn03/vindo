Vindo collects and sends the following information to servers accessed by us:

  - A unique token randomly generated when you install Vindo, as a way of distinguishing your computer from all the other ones in the world.

  - Your IP address, as a way of identifying your approximate location. (Hey, developers are curious people! However, it is not generally possible to trace your location beyond the city you live in, and we won't attempt to do so.)

  - The version of Vindo you're using, so that we can see how many people are using the latest version of Vindo and how many people are lagging behind. 

  - The names of the Windows programs and Steam games you've installed under Vindo (so we can compile statistics for programs and games used the most under Vindo and make sure those programs work correctly.)

By downloading this program, you agree not to sue, litigate, or otherwise take any legal recourse against us for any grievance regarding our programs or services. In response, we will agree to abide by the terms of this agreement and change it on the website ([vindo.co/legalese](/)) whenever the terms of it have changed.

Also, this program comes with no warranty, implied or otherwise, and we are not responsible for any issues that arise, directly or indirectly, from the use of Vindo. However, we are nice people and if you have an issue feel free to email us and we'll do our best to fix it.

Finally, Vindo is not designed or intended to be used to monitor a nuclear reactor or anything else like that. Do not stick Vindo in your ear or use it to clean your ear. Do not submerge Vindo in water, even partially. Most importantly, under no circumstances should you czyfewrhdziofjpxglzuvwvzihghohuha
