Life has reared its ugly head once again. Vindo is completed, and we have moved on to bigger and better things in life. Theodore has taken a job, I've moved (and taken a job) and Vindo languishes unused in some corner of the internet like so much open-source software. It never made it to the Mac App Store due to Apple's restrictions, but I'm told that it could be coming at some point though this seems unlikely. I finally built the computer I wanted, and Theodore has been coding like the world's gonna end on his MacBook. I've been dabbling in hashing (MD5, no salts yet) and Theodore is doing stuff so far above my paygrade I can't even begin to understand it haha. Slack is still a go-to for us, though, so if you're a Vindo user you know what to do.
