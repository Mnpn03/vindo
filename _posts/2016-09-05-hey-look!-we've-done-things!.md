I’m baaaaaack! It’s Labor Day in the United States of America, and true to my rebellious streak both Theodore and I are hard at work on various sections of Vindo. Our dreams have expanded (as so often happens, especially among Kickstarters) so due to that and just a little bit of procrastination, its taken longer than anticipated to release a nice final version of Vindo. But hey, the wait’ll be worth it once you see what we’ve done!

All accessible analytics services are out in full force on our website and Theodore has even hand-coded a special analytics service for the actual Vindo app that reports users’ IPs and which programs they have installed (we love data, and seeing what people are installing helps us know what programs are in demand thus helping us respond more accurately to the needs of our users. Because let’s be honest, who’s really gonna send us daily reports on what they need?) So far we’ve seen people install Rocket League and Steam, but hopefully we’ll get more once we start our ad campaign… which brings me to my next point. 

Ya remember that last blog post where I was sad about not having done more to further Vindo’s development? Well, I take that back now :) I’ve been working on two short videos for Vindo, one to put on the site as a quickie demo of how easy it is to install Steam, and one little ad spot that we’ll put on YouTube, just to spread the word. It’s about 5-10 seconds long (I’m actually in the middle of producing it now so I don’t have an exact time) and we’ll use Google’s AdWords for Video to get it seen. I can’t wait to see the responses to the ad! We have a web analytics service on our site called Inspectlet running that shows redirects and actually logs heatmaps, scroll tracking, and more so that we can see how users browse our site. I’m super excited to see the kind of effect my ad has on our site traffic!

On Theodore’s side, he’s hard at work integrating a chat service directly into the Vindo app, so that our users can chat us directly and we can respond. It’s going to be integrated into the Slack API, so that we can interact with it directly from Slack on desktop (for when we’re working) and Slack for iOS (for every other time). Am I worried it’ll cut into my personal life? Pssh nah, I don’t mind giving tech support in class :)

That’s all for now, but stay tuned because I’m told Theodore just pushed a non-beta version of Vindo 1.0!
