If you're one of about 2 people in the world who regularly visit this website, you'll notice a few new things, primarily this blog. The purpose of this blog is to let everyone who might look at this website know that we are still here, live and kicking, and working on Vindo hard as ever. Ling, from [LingsCars.com][ling], does this with a Live And Kicking Twitter Feed, complete with an animated chicken browsing the feed.

But I'm not that kind of artist/programmer, so I used the fact that our website's engine, [Jekyll][jekyll], is "blog-aware" to whip out a blog in about 20 lines of code. Definitely not the most polished blog, as evidenced by the fact that there are no dates, authors, or categories in this blog. That's in the works.

If you actually decide to read this blog, here are the kinds of things you might see posted:

  - Interesting announcements about Vindo, such as new version
  - Ramblings about what the heck we're doing back here
  - Really not much else
  
But we don't need much else to show that we are here, live and kicking.
