Vindo 1.0 is very nearly finished. I found a workaround for the bug I mentioned in the last blog post, and I got the UI design finished:

![It's done!][1]

And, as you can see from the animated gif, you can drag and drop the icons to rearrange them. I got rid of the annoying auto-rearranging.

I also made a box similar to the Windows Start > Run box:

![run box][2]

It's basically for running Minesweeper (type winemine), for that browse button, which lets you choose a file from anywhere in a file choose, and opening URLs in apps (e.g. steam://flushconfig).

What remains:

  - Update the icon for a windows program. It's still the old icon.
  - Set up a compatibility database on the website, so that you'll know whether your program runs on Vindo.
