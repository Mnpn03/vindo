            <p>I'm a programmer. I write code. I wrote all the code in Vindo, and designed this website. Personally, I think I did a good job. If you don't think so, well, you are entitled to your opinion.</p>
            <p>Ok, I'm not really a pilot. That picture is from when I was 8, and I had a chance to see what it's like to sit in the pilot's seat. If you want to know, there's so many buttons and switches there that it's hard to imagine how anyone is able to fly a plane.</p>

            <p>Ever wonder why Vindo runs all the Crysis games so well? I may have had a hand in that. I beta test basically every game that I own (which is many), and I pretend like I’m doing something when I’m asked what I’m working on by Theodore. It’s a good way to rationalize my gaming habit. I’m currently playing Crysis Warhead, Batman: Arkham Asylum, and Borderlands 2. I also do some visual effects work on the side as a hobby, because it’s fun.</p>
