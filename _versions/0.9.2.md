0.9.2!

Changelog:

  - Update Wine to 1.7.54, which fixes steam web browsing. You might have noticed it was broken.
  - Preinstall various runtimes, so that stuff works without you having to do anything. Such as Crysis 2.
  
The funny things flashing in and out of your dock when you create a world are a known bug. It'll be fixed soon.
