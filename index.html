    Vindo can run Windows games and programs on your Mac, without needing to boot into a separate system or launch a VM program. This means that Vindo will not waste resources in the way that virtual machines do, and won't require irritating boot times.
    </p>

    <p>
    With Vindo, when you want to run an .exe, simply double-click it. The .exe will start, and you're good to go!

                    <p>I'm a programmer. I write code. I wrote all the code in Vindo, and designed this website. Personally, I think I did a good job. If you don't think so, well, you are entitled to your opinion.</p>
                    <p>Ok, I'm not really a pilot. That picture is from when I was 8, and I had a chance to see what it's like to sit in the pilot's seat. If you want to know, there's so many buttons and switches there that it's hard to imagine how anyone is able to fly a plane.</p>

                    <p>Ever wonder why Vindo runs all the Crysis games so well? I may have had a hand in that. I beta test
                    basically every game that I own (which is many), and I pretend like I‚Äôm doing something when I‚Äôm asked
                    what I‚Äôm working on by Theodore. It‚Äôs a good way to rationalize my gaming habit. I‚Äôm currently playing
                    Crysis Warhead, Batman: Arkham Asylum, and Borderlands 2. I also do some visual effects work on the side. and I enjoy graphic design (to some extent- it's hard!)
                    I made that awesome icon you see. It was fun (and a good way to better my Maya skills...)
